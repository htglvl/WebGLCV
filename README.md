  <strong>An interactional CV I built with Unity Engine</strong>
</div>

Control the rocket to discover multiple planet, each fill with its own unique aspect of myself, or you can just fast travel, which ever you think its best. After discover every planet, it will be filled with facilities that you can explore by click on it. Just that, not much, but it have some unique feature that you don't find anywhere am I right? Especially with a knowledge focus on AI like myself, not many can have such fluent Unity skill, or maybe I am wrong, i don't know.

**Anyway, enjoy the game and explore the space.**


## Play
