  <strong>An interactional CV I built with Unity Engine</strong>
</div>

Control the rocket to discover multiple planets, each filled with its unique aspect of myself, or you can just fast-travel, whichever you think is best. After discovering every planet, it will be filled with facilities you can explore by clicking on it. Just that, not much, but it has some unique features you won't find anywhere, am I right? Especially with a knowledge focus on AI like myself, not many can have such fluent Unity skills, or maybe I am wrong; I don't know.

**Anyway, enjoy the game and explore the space.**


## Play

Go to the release section, the about section, it is everywhere! Good luck with your journey, explorer!

## Documentation

Sadly this is just a CV, It is a document.
